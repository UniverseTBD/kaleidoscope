# Meeting on Discord 2024-11-12

## Notes in the form of train-of-thought questions:
- What can we do with the MMU?
- Possibly see if different modalities have a shared embedding space?
- Does this carry over between ground based and space based telescopes?
- Can we use standard interp tools to explore this?
- Can we do so directly on the data without first pretraining a foundation model?
- Why would we _even want_ do do this?
- How can we probe whether the embedding space is shared if we train a SAE?
    - via downstream tasks?
    - which downstream tasks?
    - can we borrow from text world?
- would it be worthwhile to train a "pythia" suite on the MMU?
